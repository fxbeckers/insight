###National Hack the Government 2014

[in]sight’s aim is to make government data accessible to the public in a manner that’s easy to digest.
It tries to accomplish this by highlighting interesting insights about data in your immediate area as it
relates to the wider surrounding area.  The insight engine is designed to be agnostic to the inputs it
receives, allowing it to highlight information that may be bespoke to your particular area as well as
other interesting and relevant data wherever you may travel.  Go Team!  Happy hacking!
